# Change Log

## 3.0.0 (March 2024)

### Added

- Added a 3D mode. Users can now sketch samples on 3D terrain and 3D feature layers (i.e., 3D building layers).

- Added a hybrid shape mode to help support 3D mode.

- Added the ability to publish supporting reference layers with a plan.

- Added the ability to publish Web Map/Scene with a plan.

- Added automated integration tests.

- Added a measurement widget to the map for both 2D and 3D modes.

- Added the ability to select multiple samples by drawing a rectangle/polygon on the map. This is only supported in 2D mode or by holding shift/ctrl and clicking on samples.

- Added ability to clone layers and plans.

### Changed

- Updated One EPA template.

- Updated Google Analytics code to work with the new GA4 tags.

- Updated dependencies to the latest versions including: ArcGIS JS API, NodeJS and React.
